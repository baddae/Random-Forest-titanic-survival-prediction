# Random-Forest-titanic-survival-prediction

## Overview
This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates the use of Random Forest, a popular machine learning algorithm, to predict survival on the Titanic. The dataset used is a hypothetical dataset containing information about passengers on the Titanic, such as age, gender, ticket class, and whether they survived or not.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis is the Titanic dataset, which is commonly used in machine learning tutorials and competitions. It contains the following columns:
- PassengerId: Unique identifier for each passenger
- Survived: Whether the passenger survived (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
- Pclass: Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)
- Name: Passenger's name
- Sex: Passenger's gender
- Age: Passenger's age
- SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard
- Parch: Number of parents/children aboard
- Ticket: Ticket number
- Fare: Passenger fare
- Cabin: Cabin number
- Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)

## Analysis
1. **Data Exploration**: 
   - Exploratory data analysis to understand the structure and distribution of the data.
   - Handling missing values and data preprocessing.

2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Creating new features or transforming existing features to improve model performance.

3. **Model Building**:
   - Using Random Forest classifier from scikit-learn to build the predictive model.
   - Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
   - Training the model on the training data.

4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluating the model's performance using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Visualizing the model's performance using confusion matrix and ROC curve.

5. **Predictions**:
   - Making predictions on the test set.
   - Investigating the predictions and analyzing the model's strengths and weaknesses.
